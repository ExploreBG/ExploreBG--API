Information and signposts have been installed along the route of the tourist eco-trail. There are designated recreation areas, outdoor barbecue facilities, sports and recreation attractions in places with unique views.
       There are many cultural-historical and natural attractions along the trail, but among the most impressive are: Locality "Sharapani" - preserved monuments from the Old Iron Age in the area. "Sharapani" (wine stone) are artificially carved hollows in the rocks, made by humans 2600-2800 years ago. Each sharapana consists of two unequal basins with a sloping floor and an open or closed channel. The name "sharapana" comes from the Turkish word "sharap" and means wine. Based on this, we judge that the inhabitants of these places processed grapes for wine in them. Another theory is that Sharapanas were used in ancient times to wash and extract gold as the area was rich in gold deposits.
       The "Aikaas" locality is located on the western slope of the "Mechkovets" mountain hill (Aida peak), immediately below a natural rock ridge. It offers a panoramic view to the west and south, towards the interior of the Rhodopes, which impresses greatly with its beauty and a range of more than 30 km. The forest is deciduous, beech and oak. Nearby is a natural deposit of lily of the valley and wild peony, whose beauty you can enjoy in the spring.
